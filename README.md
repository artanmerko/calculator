3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
4. Add a “clear” button.
5. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
6. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
